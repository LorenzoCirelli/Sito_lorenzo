      "In addition to work, one of my greatest passions is cycling, exploring new routes, and immersing myself in nature or the lesser-known streets of cities. I also love spending time with friends, chatting, and sharing laughs in a relaxed atmosphere. Whenever I get the chance, I enjoy traveling and discovering new cities, wandering through their streets and getting to know the local culture. I often look for hidden corners and less-frequented places, spots that tell authentic stories and offer unique emotions. Iâ€™m always seeking adventures that enrich my spirit and allow me to see the world from new perspectives.",
